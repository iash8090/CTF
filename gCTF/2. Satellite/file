On your way down to earth you almost collided with that communications satellite.
Stepping out to inspect, you find some space junk labeled “init_sat”. It looks like
humans run it to set up satellites.
Is the communication with the satellite really as secure as those humans always claim?
Could this help you read the space-static to learn more about earth creatures, and
whether to join the party down there? You load init_sat on your terminal.
